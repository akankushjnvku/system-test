      <description>The Best Of Times by Deck Deckert
(Swans - October 24, 2005)  It is the best of times; it is the worst of times.
President George W. Bush is the worst president in my long lifetime,
and probably the worst in American history -- I'll leave the latter
to the historians.
A list of his sins of commission and omission would fill an
encyclopedia -- mass murder in the shape of an immoral war, an
embrace of torture, delusions of empire, financial meltdown, massive
corruption, misfeasance and malfeasance, the attempted trashing of
the Constitution and Bill of Rights, environmental destruction, and
lies, lies, lies.
What have we come to?
If we had elected him, it could perhaps be said that we got what
we deserve. But, of course, we didn't elect him. The last two
presidential elections were stolen -- if not literally, though I
believe they were, then in practice in the form of massive manipulation
of minority voters, particularly in Florida in the 2000 election.
And because the Democrats were too befuddled and cowardly to raise
a fuss and the corporate media was cravenly silent, all future
elections are in doubt.
Yet elected or not, Bush is not the nation -- his values are not
our values. But then the value of our leaders never are.
Bush is just the latest in a long line of presidents who don't serve
our interests, but serve instead the interests of corporations and
the other portions of the ruling elite. He may be the worst, but
he is hardly unique.
The corporatization of America, which has been going on for decades,
is nearly complete. Corporations own the government, pay little or
no taxes, get massive government handouts, and almost totally control
our access to information. Their lobbyists have immediate and
frequent access to the president, congressmen and senators, sit in
on congressional committee sessions, and generally make the rules
that are supposed to govern them.
Corporations control not only the federal government but state
governments as well. States frequently brag that they are good
places for business. By that they generally mean that taxes are
low, unions are powerless, wages and benefits are poor, workplace
safety and environmental regulations are weak. In other words, what
is good for corporations is bad for workers -- and everyone else.
But while Bush has aggressively pushed the corporation agenda, he
is not the first to do so. Clinton, for example, was nearly as bad.
Bush's values are those of an aging ignorant spoiled playboy --
primarily hedonism. The values of his puppet-masters are far more
ominous -- greed, a love of power, and the arrogant assumption that
they have a manifest destiny to rule the world.
The values of the American people are the values of people almost
everywhere. Forget the national stereotypes -- not all British have
stiff upper lips, not all Canadians are polite, not all Scotsmen
are penny pinchers, not all American tourists are arrogant, loud
and boisterous.
Most Americans live quiet lives, centered on family, church and
friends. They perhaps embrace individualism more than most of the
world's people, are a bit more convinced that their country is the
greatest, and are more concerned with acquiring material goods.
They pay lip service to the idea of equality, however little they
may practice it. They are generally optimistic. They don't condone
torture, murder of innocents, or invasion of nations that don't
threaten them.
But, contrary to their own beliefs, they are easily led. Unscrupulous
leaders, and a compliant media, can easily convince them that they
are in grave danger, and the solution is yet another war.
So is this the worst of times?
Compared to?
People think there was a golden age in which there was peace, all
Americans were prosperous, and everyone was happy. When was this?
Was it when the country was founded by the slaughter of millions
of Native Americans and the stealing of their land?
Was it when rich plantation owners owned slaves?
Was it when country was engaged in a vicious civil war that killed
600,000 to 700,000 people?
Or the post-Civil War period when freed slaves were brought back
under control by lynchings and segregation?
Was it during the Depression, when millions were hungry and out of
work?
Was it during World War II, when more than 50 million people died,
including 500,000 Americans?
Or how about in the post-World War II period, a time of optimism
and prosperity -- unless of course you were poor and black, or
fighting in Korea?
Was it during the civil rights revolution, a time of joyous
reaffirmation of our ideals, and the murder of civil rights workers?
Was it during the concurrent Vietnam war protests in which millions
marched in the streets, followed by the assassination of national
leaders?
Perhaps this is the best of times?
All right, perhaps not. But it is a time of great potential, if we
do not despair. The stranglehold of the corporate media is under
attack on the Internet by blogs and other sources of news. The
ugliness and corruption of the radical right of the Republican Party
is now exposed for all to see and some of the worst offenders may
get their comeuppance in court. A few Democrats are finally beginning
to develop some backbone. Some states and cities are beginning to
rebel against some of the worst assaults on the bill of rights;
others are working to protect our voting rights.
The best of times? No, it's just life.
